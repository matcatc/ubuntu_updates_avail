This is a simple script that I wrote in order to display update info in my
conky.

Simply run it on a cron job, then cat in the outputted file in your conky
(${execi <interval> cat ~/.conky/ubuntu_updates_avail.info})

See the --help output for a list of command line options.

Note that it requires root privileges to call apt-get update.

See the in file documentation for more info (including licensing.)

Because of the nature of the script, it is very difficult to test. I think I
probably could write unit tests for all of it by extracting the subprocess
calls to their own objects then mocking them, but doing so might not be
worthwhile. Anyways, until I get testing setup, the script is not going to be
extensively tested. So bug reports will be very much appreciated. If I don't
see the bug when running the script myself, then I am relient on you and other
users to report them to me, so please do.
