This is a simple script that I wrote in order to display update info in my
conky.

Simply run it on a cron job, then cat in the outputted file in your conky
(${execi <interval> cat ~/.conky/ubuntu_updates_avail.info})

Its currently not designed to be configurable via command line options, so
you'll have to go in and edit the file if you want it to act differently.
The only thing most people will want to change is the output, which should
be easy to do even if you don't know python - just change the string named
`output`.)

Note that it requires root privileges to call apt-get update.

See the in file documentation for more info (including licensing.)
