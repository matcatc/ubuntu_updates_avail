The items in this file aren't in order, but generally items towards the top are more important.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- run ddd0fc0f5a on system with template
    if there's no obvious bugs after running for a while, go ahead and merge in master and push to origin.
        whatever feels like long enough. A week is probably fine.

- refactoring
    split the script into functions
        localization of code
    add a main() function
    localize imports?


items to consider:
no particular order
-------------------

- option: max width of output
    That way the output won't get too long and mess up conky
    Should be easy, just use textwrap module

- option: no update if no internet?
    make default?
        then provide a way to override (--force-update or --always-update)
    what about cases where the user has a local mirror?
        as long as the proper adddress is specified, our current network checking code should work.

- option: --no-root
    don't do anything requiring root

- option: --no-update
    don't update
    b/c:
        system may already be
        reduces runtime
        script may not be smart enough (e.g: local mirror and no internet, script may terminate early b/c in a normal setup the computer wouldn't be able to update)
        may be running regularly to debug, and don't want it updating a lot
 
- no ping output to terminal
    not high priority b/c only times users will see this is when debugging/ trying out for the first time
        although first impressions are pretty important

- other time formats
    current time format is long and annoying
    perhaps a way for the user to specify
        command line option
        in template
            might require parsing the template and removing stuff
            perhaps could pass template through time printing function

- KISS
    is the script becoming too complicated?

- short command line options
    going to be hard to do well

- option: server address
    allow user to specify the server to ping in order to verify network connectivity

- better looking --help output

- add docs (docbook) ?
    the script has certainly gotten large enough that a manpage may be desired
    or perhaps just update the README?

- change default output to something more sensible.
